# PUBG Intro Remover
###### if something like this already existed, I was unaware (use that instead)

### This program will remove your PUBG intro videos with a press of a button. Just run the program every update.

## Increase start times by **11 seconds**!!!

With the crashing crisis I have been experiencing, I found removing these files did the following for me while playing:

1. Not drive me insane with absolutely ridiculously loud music every time I start the game
2. Increase start up times by 11 seconds which can save your damn life!

## How to use
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/TheBoogle/PUBGIntroRemover/releases/latest) of the program
2. Open the program and it should ask you for your PUBG directory, if its not already automatically highlighted, you can navigate to it and select it.
3. Press the remove intros button.

#### Thats all you have to do.

## If you don't trust this program, you can manually do this.

Navigate to your PUBG folder > TslGame\Content\Movies > and delete LoadingScreen.mp4 and LicenseScreen.mp4

Downside to doing it manually is, well its manual and you have to manually do it every update.

## Why can't I open the source code for this project?

This project was created in a program called [Clickteam Fusion 2.5](https://www.clickteam.com/clickteam-fusion-2-5) and it uses an event based programming language, meaning no real code. 

(Not that I can't write real code, but I am lazy and this project will probably be downloaded 0 times)

I have decided to screenshot all the events, just so you can still have an idea of what this will be doing
